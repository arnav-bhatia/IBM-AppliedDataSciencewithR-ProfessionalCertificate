## About this Course
This course serves as an introductory guide to SQL for learners. Beginning with the fundamental syntax of queries, it progressively transitions into the integration of SQL queries within an R environment.

The course has six modules:
-	Getting Started with SQL
-	Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables
-	Intermediate SQL
-	Getting Started with Databases using R
-	Working with Database Objects using R
-	Course Project

With a comprehensive understanding of SQL acquired through a Postgre SQL course completed a few months ago, I swiftly navigated through the SQL sections. Additionally, I honed my ability to execute SQL queries within an R environment using RSQLite, a crucial skill for aspiring Data Scientists.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Basic SQL
-	Relational Databases and Tables
-	Functions and Sub-queries
-	Connecting to Databases from R

In the final course project, I analyzed crop production in Canada using SQL queries within an R environment. My tasks included creating database tables, loading datasets into R, and executing targeted SQL queries to extract relevant information. It was a good test for my SQL queries and I finished it without too much difficulty. There was also a course final exam which I passed easily.

The final ipynb file containing the project is provided in this folder (The Kernel has to be set to R).
