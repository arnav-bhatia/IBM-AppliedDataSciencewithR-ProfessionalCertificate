## About this Professional Certificate
The program is designed to equip learners with essential data analytical skills utilizing R. It commences with foundational R concepts, gradually progressing towards the integration of SQL within the R environment. Subsequently, emphasis is placed on refining data science proficiencies through comprehensive instruction in data analysis and visualization using R. The culmination of the program entails a comprehensive final project, encompassing all aspects covered throughout the course.

The program contains nine courses:
-	Introduction to R Programming for Data Science
-	SQL for Data Science with R
-	Data Analysis with R
-	Data Visualization with R
-	Data Science with R – Capstone Project

## Applied Learning Project

In this hands-on learning experience, the learner will develop a diverse portfolio and acquire practical skills using SQL and the R programming language, alongside essential libraries for data science such as Tidyverse, Tidymodels, R Shiny, ggplot2, Leaflet, and rvest.

Some of the projects in the program:
-	Identifying patterns in countries’ COVID-19 testing data rates using R.
-	Analyzing foreign grain markets using SQL with the RODBC R package.
-	Building linear and polynomial regression models to predict precipitation with weather station data.
-	Designing a dashboard with the R Shiny package to explore trends in census data.
-	Developing an interactive dashboard with hypothesis testing and predictive modelling, integrated with a dynamic Leaflet map widget, to investigate weather's impact on bike-sharing demand.

At the end of the program, the learner will complete a real-world capstone project specifically designed to showcase their newly learned data analyst skills.
