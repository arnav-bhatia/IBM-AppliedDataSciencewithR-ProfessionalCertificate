## About this Course

The final course in the comprehensive program is a capstone project testing the learnerâ€™s newly acquired data analytical skills with R.

The course has six modules:
-	Capstone Overview and Data Collection
-	Data Wrangling
-	Performing Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL, Tidyverse and ggplot2
-	Predictive Analysis
-	Building a R Shiny Dashboard App
-	Present Your Data-Driven Insights

This project tackles the challenge of maintaining an ideal supply of rental bikes in urban areas. Demand fluctuates significantly due to weather and seasonal changes, making it difficult to keep enough bikes available. This project aimed to develop a model that predicts hourly bike rental demand based on current weather conditions.
The model incorporates environmental variables, weekday, and season to optimize bike supply, ensuring a smooth bike-sharing experience for both managers and users.

## The Data Journey
The first step involved data collection from various sources. This stage involved scraping a comprehensive Global Bike Sharing Systems Dataset from Wikipedia, accessing Weather Data via OpenWeather API, and integrating Historical bike demand data from a CSV file.

## Data Wrangling
Next came data wrangling, where we standardized column names, extracted numerical values using regular expressions, handled missing values, created dummy variables for categorical variables, and finally normalized the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this stage, we performed exploratory data analysis using RSQLite and ggplot2. We wrote R Studio queries to gain valuable insights from the dataset, followed by visualizations created with ggplot2 to further analyze the data and identify any hidden patterns.

## Building the Model
After data wrangling and exploration, we built multiple regression models and selected the most suitable one for predicting bike demand based on weather patterns.

## Interactive Dashboard
Stage five involved using the built models to create an interactive R Shiny dashboard. This dashboard allows users to predict bike demand in any chosen city by analyzing its weather patterns.

## Sharing the Knowledge
Finally, we documented the entire project process and its results in a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation.

This project, while challenging, was ultimately very rewarding. Completing this specialization has significantly boosted my confidence in using R for data analysis tasks.

The completed ipynb files(to be run using the R kernel), the R Studio scripts for the Dashboard and the PowerPoint Presentation are provided in this folder.
