## About this Course
This course provides a comprehensive overview of data visualization using R, beginning with fundamental plots and progressing to advanced topics such as map creation and interactive dashboard development using Shiny.

The course has four modules:
-	Introduction to Data Visualization
-	Basic Plots, Maps, and Customization
-	Dashboards
-	Final Assignment

I found the course challenging due to the complexity of data visualization in coding, which requires mastery of various attributes. Additionally, I believe the course could have dedicated more time to developing fundamental visualization skills before delving into advanced topics like maps and interactive dashboards.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	ggplot2
-	Leaflet
-	Shiny

The final course project concluded with the creation of an interactive dashboard using R Shiny, utilizing demographic data from various regions worldwide. Although challenging, completing the project was immensely gratifying. Additionally, I performed well on the final exam, achieving a high score.

The final R Studio files containing the project code are provided in this folder and a screenshot of the dashboard is shown below.
