## About this Course
This course is an introduction to R programming for the leaner. It will cover the basics of the language and will move on to slightly more advanced topics in later sections.

The course has five modules:
-	R Basics
-	Common Data Structures
-	R Programming Fundamentals
-	Working with Data
- Final Project

I possess a degree of familiarity with R, which enabled me to grasp most of the concepts covered. Nonetheless, the course served as a valuable refresher on R for me.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	R Data Structures
-	R Conditionals and Loops
- Importing Data
-	Web Scraping

The final project required me to procure COVID-19 data by web scraping a public wiki page before analysing it using R and coming up with key insights. It was a fun simple project. There was also a course final exam which I passed with full marks.

The final ipynb file containing the project is provided in this folder (The Kernel has to be set to R).
