## About this Course
This course instructs learners in essential techniques for data analysis using R. Topics covered include data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and regression model building.

The course has six modules:
-	Introduction to Data Analysis with R
-	Data Wrangling
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Model Development in R
-	Model Evaluation
-	Project

I was introduced to a lot of new R concepts related to data analysis so this was an informative course which I enjoyed.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Data Wrangling
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Regression Models
-	Model Evaluation

The final course project involved conducting data analysis on a provided dataset containing weather data from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Applying the concepts learned throughout the course, I found the project fairly straightforward. I also completed the final exam with relative ease.

The final R Studio file containing the final project is provided in this folder.
